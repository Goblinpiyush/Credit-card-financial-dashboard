# Credit-card-financial-dashboard
üîçThe objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard to provide real-time insights into credit card transactions and customer behavior. The aim was to monitor key performance metrics and trends, identify opportunities for improving customer experience, and support data-driven decision-making processes.I sourced the data from a publicly available dataset on GitHub. This dataset included details on credit card transactions, such as transaction amounts, dates, and customer demographics."

I first loaded the dataset into a MySQL database to enable efficient data management and manipulation. This involved importing the CSV files from GitHub into MySQL tables.In MySQL Workbench, I performed various data cleaning and manipulation tasks, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing data formats, and creating new calculated fields. This ensured the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Once the data was cleaned and manipulated in MySQL, I exported the tables to Power BI using the MySQL connector.The dashboard consists of several key components, including visualizations for transaction volumes, spending trends, customer segmentation, and top spending categories. I used a combination of bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers to allow for interactive analysis.

I used MySQL for data storage and manipulation, MySQL Workbench for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for data visualization.

One of the challenges was ensuring the data was refreshed in real-time. I implemented scheduled data refreshes in Power BI to keep the dashboard updated with the latest information.
